      SPC defines the camera X axis to be increasing to the right, Y to
      be increasing down, and Z to point into the page:

                      Z
                    /
                   /
                  o---> X
                  |
                Y |
                  v

      SPICE may use a different convention.  Use the flip parameters to
      map the camera axes to SPICE axes.  flipI = J sets camera axis I
      to SPICE axis J, where I is an axis name (X, Y, or Z), and J is a
      signed integer number for an axis. The values of J can be (-1, 1,
      -2, 2, -3, or 3), indicating the (-X, X, -Y, Y, -Z, Z) axis,
      respectively.  The user must take care to correctly enter the
      flipI values so that the resulting flipped axes form a
      well-defined, right-handed coordinate system.

      Examples:
         (flipX, flipY, flipZ) = ( 1, 2, 3) SPICE and camera frames coincide.
         (flipX, flipY, flipZ) = ( 2,-1, 3) SPICE frame is camera frame rotated 90 degrees about Z.
         (flipX, flipY, flipZ) = (-2, 1, 3) SPICE frame is camera frame rotated -90 degrees about Z.
         (flipX, flipY, flipZ) = ( 1,-2,-3) rotates the image 180 degrees about X.""")
